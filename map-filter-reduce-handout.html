//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
//var numbersAddOne = [];
//for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
  //  numbersAddOne.push(numbers[i] +1);
    //}
//}
//console.log(numbersAddOne); //2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~
let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(function(num){
    return num + 1;
})



console.log(numbersAddOneMap);


//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins
const favoriteRestaurant = [
    {
        name: "Yonkers Pizza Co.",
        address: "somehwere in highland park village",
        phone: "(555)-555-5555"
    },
    {
        name:"Dona Mary",
        address: "somewhere in east plano",
        phone: "(972)555-5555"
    },
    {
        name: "Ricky's Hot Chicken",
        address: "somehwere in richardson",
        phone: "(469) 555-5555",
    }];
//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins
let nameList = favoriteRestaurant.map(function(){
    return favoriteRestaurant.name

    console.log(nameList)
})
//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)


//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!
var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
let evens = numbers.filter(function(num){
    return num % 2 === 0;

    console.log(evens)
})

//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants

//let hasBuffet = favoriteRestaurant.filter(function(restaurant){
  //  return restaurant.restaurantFeatures.includes("buffet")
//})


//console.log(hasBuffet)


//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!

let isChicken = favoriteRestaurant.filter(function(restaurant) {
    return restaurant.name.includes("Chicken")
})


console.log(isChicken)

//TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!

//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!

let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

//in the past we would have built out a loop and probably used a var of sum and had a look inside of the loop of sum += numbers [i]

// In es6 with . reduce();

let sum = numbers.reduce(function(total,num){
    return total + num;
}, 0)


console.log("Our numbers added up are " + sum);






//TODO Together: Let's take a step a bit deeper with .reduce() - .reduce()'s output can take many forms and shapes. For example, let's say we wanted to have a little Javascript that would count the length of the strings in an array and return that info back to us in an object. For example: ["Codeup", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco Cohort", "ES6"] would get us {}

let stringArr = ["Codeup", "San", "Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco", "Cohort", "ES6"];

let strLengthObj = stringArr.reduce(function(object, element) {
    object[element] = element.length; //assign the length as a value of th property names element {elementName: elementLength}
    return object;
},{})

console.log(strLengthObj);





//TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string
function countWords(sentence) {
    const words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words
    const wordCountObject = words.reduce((wordCounts, word) => {
        if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
            // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
            wordCounts[word] = 1;
        } else {
            // otherwise increment the existing count
            wordCounts[word] += 1;
        }
        return wordCounts;
    }, {}); // start with an empty object
    return wordCountObject;
}

countWords('Mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb');
// {Mary: 1, had: 1, a: 1, little: 3, lamb: 3}

//TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!

function countWords(sentence) {
    let words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words
     words = words.filter(function(word) {
        if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
            // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
            wordCounts[word] = 1;
        } else {
            // otherwise increment the existing count
            wordCounts[word] += 1;
        }
        return wordCounts;
    }, {}); // start with an empty object
    return wordCountObject;
}

countWords('Mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb');









//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).
let famArr = [{
    name: "A. Sheikh",
    age: 64
}, {
    name: "N. Sheikh",
    age: 61
}, {
    name: "I. Sheikh",
    age: 26
}]

let sumFamilyAges = famArr.reduce(function(total, familyMember){
    
}
